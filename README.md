# uBlock YouTube Shorts Filter List

This is a fork of the original [gijsdev/ublock-hide-yt-shorts](https://github.com/gijsdev/ublock-hide-yt-shorts) project, with more up-to-date filters. This is a filter list for [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) that hides all traces of YouTube Shorts videos, except under YouTube's History tab.

## Installation

To use this filter list with uBlock Origin:

> Copy the following link:
> - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Harren06/ublock-yt-shorts/main/list.txt`
>
> Open uBlock Origin and navigate to:
> - Dashboard > Filter lists
>
> Scroll down and paste the link into the 'Import...' field.
>
> Click "Apply changes" and refresh your YouTube page.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for changes or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Please note that when YouTube updates its interface or add new features, this filter list may break. If you notice that certain content isn't being filtered anymore, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
